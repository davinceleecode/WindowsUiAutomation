# WindowsUiAutomation
Windows provides a programmatic interface to automate various elements. Windows Automation saves time and effort in executing regression test cases. 

I created a sample UiAutomation which has different interaction to UiControls.

* TabControl
* RadioButton
* ComboBox
* TextBox
* Button
